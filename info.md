This script adds MQTT discovery support for Shelly Gen2 devices in the [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/).

## Prerequisites

This script needs Home Assistant `python_script` component so, if you never used it, I strongly suggest you to follow the [official instruction](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/python_script#writing-your-first-script) and check that `python_script` is properly configured and it's working.

For the device to work with the script, it must have MQTT configured and options **RPC status notifications over MQTT** and **Generic status update over MQTT** enabled.

## Installation

You can download `shellies_discovery_gen2.py` file and save it in `<config>/python_scripts` folder.

Shellies Discovery Gen2 will automatically install/update the script on your Shelly device. Due to `python_scripts` integration limitations, updating the device script requires the `announce` automation to run twice.

## Supported devices

- Shelly Plus 1
- Shelly Plus 1PM
- Shelly Plus 2PM
- Shelly Plus H&T
- Shelly Plus I4
- Shelly Plus Wall Dimmer
- Shelly Pro 1
- Shelly Pro 1PM
- Shelly Pro 2
- Shelly Pro 2PM
- Shelly Pro 3
- Shelly Pro 4PM

## Battery powered devices

Battery powered devices like Plus H&T are put to sleep most of the time. For this reason, adding/updating entities configuration for a device should be done as follows:

- enter the device into setup mode (press the button on the device)
- manually run `Shellies Announce Gen2` automation

## How to debug

To debug the script add this to your `logger` configuration:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml file
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.python_script: debug
    homeassistant.components.automation: info
```

## Supported platforms

- binary sensor
- button
- fan
- light
- sensor
- switch
- update

## Supported features

- the device name is taken from the device configuration
- the relay name is taken from the device configuration
- the relay consumption type is taken from the device configuration (consumption type must contain `light` or `fan` to configure light or fan platform)
- if the input type is set to button, device automation triggers are available
- custom MQTT prefixes are supported

## Script arguments

key | optional | type | default | description
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
`discovery_prefix` | True | string | `homeassistant` | MQTT discovery prefix
`qos` | True | integer | `0` | MQTT QoS, you can use `0`, `1` or `2`

## Configuration

```yaml
# configuration.yaml file
python_script:

# automations.yaml file
- id: shellies_announce_gen2
  alias: "Shellies Announce Gen2"
  trigger:
    - platform: homeassistant
      event: start
  variables:
    device_info_payload:  "{{ {'id': 1, 'src':'shellies_discovery', 'method':'Shelly.GetConfig'} | to_json }}"
    device_ids:  # enter the list of device IDs here
      - shellyplus2pm-485519a1ff8c
      - shellyplus1pm-112233445566
  action:
    - repeat:
        for_each: "{{ device_ids }}"
        sequence:
          - service: mqtt.publish
            data:
              topic: "{{ repeat.item }}/rpc"
              payload: "{{ device_info_payload }}"

- id: shellies_discovery_gen2
  alias: "Shellies Discovery Gen2"
  mode: queued
  max: 999
  trigger:
  - platform: mqtt
    topic: shellies_discovery/rpc
  action:
  - service: python_script.shellies_discovery_gen2
    data:
      id: "{{ trigger.payload_json.src }}"
      device_config: "{{ trigger.payload_json.result }}"
